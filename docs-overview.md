# Docs Branch Overview

    This branch contains all the non-code related documentation, designs, and planning materials for the project. It is separate from the main codebase to maintain a clean separation between code and project documentation.

# Purpose of this Branch

    This branch is intended to keep all the design, planning, and documentation files separate from the codebase, making it easier to manage and navigate both the technical and non-technical aspects of the project. The goal is to have a clear record of how the project evolved, the research behind decisions, and the designs being implemented.
